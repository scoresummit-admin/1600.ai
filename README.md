# 1600.ai

**1600.ai** is an experimental research project aimed at building an AI system that can achieve a near-perfect score on the SAT (targeting ‚â•1580, ideally 1600) using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), program-aided math solving, and evidence-based reasoning.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The goal of **1600.ai** is simple but ambitious:  
**zero (or near-zero) mistakes on the SAT.**

We‚Äôre testing the limits of LLMs by combining:
- **Multi-model routing & ensembling**: GPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking, o4-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5, and Qwen2.5-Math.  
- **Tool-augmented math solving**: Program-of-Thought (PoT) with Python execution + verification.  
- **Evidence-based EBRW solving**: Extract claims, quote support, run verifier passes, eliminate distractors.  
- **Routing by domain**: Different models and strategies for Math vs. Evidence-Based Reading & Writing (EBRW).  
- **Verifier > voter**: Verified solutions trump raw majority vote.

## üß© SAT Domains Covered

**Evidence-Based Reading & Writing (EBRW)**
- Craft & Structure  
- Information & Ideas  
- Standard English Conventions (grammar, punctuation, usage)  
- Expression of Ideas (organization, concision, style)

**Math**
- Algebra  
- Advanced Math (nonlinear functions, quadratics, polynomials)  
- Problem-Solving & Data Analysis (ratios, percents, statistics)  
- Geometry & Trigonometry  
- Calculator active for all questions (modeled in pipeline)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture (high level)

1. **Router**  
   - Detects section + subdomain, normalizes input, sets time budget.

2. **Solver**  
   - **Math**: Concurrent trio (GPT-5, Grok-4, DeepSeek-R1) with Python verification ‚Üí aggregate best result.  
   - **EBRW**: Concurrent quartet (O3, GPT-5, Grok-4, Claude Sonnet 4) ‚Üí evidence extraction ‚Üí verified by Claude/Grok.  

3. **Verifier**  
   - Math: substitution, domain/unit checks, symbolic verification.  
   - EBRW: evidence existence + secondary judge pass.  

4. **Aggregator**  
   - Weighted blend of solver + verifier outputs.  
   - Select best result from concurrent model outputs.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Targets

- **Accuracy**:  
  - ‚â•99.5% Math  
  - ‚â•99% EBRW  
  - Across official practice tests, ‚â§2 total errors ‚Üí ‚â•1580 score.  

- **Latency**:  
  - p95 ‚â§ 30 seconds per question  
  - Escalations allowed but bounded
